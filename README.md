## Development approach for an innovative Autonomous Undersea Surveyor System (AUS2)
This repository contains a development approach for an innovative Autonomous Undersea Surveyor System (AUS2).  It exists to elaborate  “primitive needs" (opinion based on casual observation tempered with experienced judgement) to conduct geophysical and geotechnical ocean surveys through a set of Systems Engineering development phases:

* Mission Analysis
* Stakeholder Needs & Requirements Definition
* System Requirements Definition
* Architecture Definition
* Design Definition
* System Analysis
* Test and Evaluation
* Operation, Maintenance, and Disposal
* Life Cycle Management

This repository is intended to communicate and improve upon a rationale and approach for development of the AUS2 as a proposed enterprise system of systems solution that can meet the “effective need” (comprehensive and underlying requirement) for a more efficient and effective ocean survey capability.

The enterprise system of systems solution envisioned in this repository is delivered through a decentralized working capital fund enterprise organization.  Consistent with a decentralized enterprise organization approach, the enduring instance of the content in this informal report is published to a git repository under a creative commons license in order to enable distributed ownership of, and continuous improvement on the AUS2 development approach, and enterprise organization business case.
