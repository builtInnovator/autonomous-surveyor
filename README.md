## Development approach for an innovative Autonomous Undersea Surveyor System (AUS2)
This repository contains a development approach for an innovative Autonomous Undersea Surveyor System (AUS2).  It exists to elaborate  “primitive” needs for more efficient and effective ocean survey capability through a set of Systems Engineering development phases:

* Mission Analysis
* Stakeholder Needs & Requirements Definition
* System Requirements Definition
* Architecture Definition
* Design Definition
* System Analysis
* Test and Evaluation
* Operation, Maintenance, and Disposal
* Life Cycle Management

This repository is intended to communicate aand improve upon a rationale and approach for development of the AUS2 as a proposed enterprise system of systems solution that meets the “effective” need for more efficient and effective ocean survey capability.  The enterprise system of systems solution is delivered through a decentralized working capital fund enterprise organization.  Consistent with a decentralized enterprise organization approach, the enduring instance of this content is published to a git repository under a creative commons license in order to enable distributed ownership of, and continuous improvement on the AUS2 development approach, and enterprise organization business case.
